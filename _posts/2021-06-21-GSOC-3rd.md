Well, it's a bit late for weekly update that it should be rather called decadly update. But well, better than nothing!

## WIP: Safety flag

Related:
* Backend: [libxfce4util !16](https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/libxfce4util/-/merge_requests/16)
* UI: [Thunar !121](https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/-/merge_requests/121)
* Additional discussions: [Thunar #156](https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/-/issues/156)

I'm still working on safety-flag, which is mentioned in [my introduction post](/GSOC-2021/) and [2nd saturday post](/2nd-Saturday/). Not much have changed, but now an interface for safety flag is going to be merged into `libxfce4util`. Also, this flag will only be used for .desktop files.

Also, the UI part of this project also got its MR page [(Thunar !121)](https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/-/merge_requests/121). Several discussion later [(startig from here)](https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/-/issues/156#note_33081), we decided to put checkbox for safety flag on Property->Launcher. Because flicking trusted flag on should also trigger executable flag on, it would be preferrable to show it visually. Thus toggle button for executable flag would also be on Launcher tab. So this would be how it will look like:

## Additional update

Related: [libxfce4ui !42](https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/libxfce4ui/-/merge_requests/42) (42 is a nice number!)

While I was working on safety flag, I got distracted by the boilerplates used on several XFCE projects, which was a direct copy of `thunar_gtk_label_set_a11y_relation()`. To use this function accros XFCE projects, I ported this to `libxfce4ui` as [`xfce_gtk_label_set_a11y_relation()`](https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/libxfce4ui/-/merge_requests/42). Doesn't it feel good when duplicate codes are replaced with proper functions?
