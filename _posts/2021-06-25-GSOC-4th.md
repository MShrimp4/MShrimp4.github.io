Another update!

## Safety flag - almost done!
Related : [Thunar !121](https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/-/merge_requests/121)

Interface for safety flag is almost done. A bit more polishing and it would be good to go.

## Exo-Desktop-Item-Edit
### Keep metadata on edit
Related : [xfdesktop #68](https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/xfdesktop/-/issues/68)->[Exo #64](https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/exo/-/issues/64), [Exo !43](https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/exo/-/merge_requests/43)

exo-desktop-item-edit, which is used to edit .desktop files, removed metadata while writing changes. This caused permission bits to be reset without execution bit. It is now patched to preserve metadata (including safety flag and execution bit).

### Support for safety flag
Related : [Exo !44](https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/exo/-/merge_requests/44)

While fixing previous issue, I added an optional feature to support safety flag on exo-desktop-item-edit. Now if `libxfce4util` supports safety flag, .desktop file will be created with safety flag on.
